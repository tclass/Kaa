# Kaa
Kaa uses speech recognition so you can execute commands via speaking to your PC

To Do:

- use own API Key for Google API
- start recognition on key stroke
- if no command was found play sound
- use Sphinx for voice recognition
- add a script folder for own scripts
- add selenium support (maybe you want to click on a website or anything)
- GUI


Libraries:
SpeechRecognition # uses a default Google API Key, only for dev environments
ConfigParser # parsing the config wow!
